# xcode-github-method

How to do it.

Start project in xcode.  When it asks for source control, create a repot on the mac.  Commit and push your intial checkin.

Start chrome and go to github.  Create a new repot.  Copy the ssh based remote info.  Do not create a readme or any files
in the repot.

1. Go back to xcode.  Click source control-><proj name>-master->configure <proj name>
2. Switch to remote. Click + control.  Click add remote, not create new remote.
3.  Add server.  Paste in the ssh remote info from github.
4. Push changes.

Now you are working on github for your git repot.
